Download It Free Today  Venture Capital UpdatesHongShan, the Chinese investment firm that separated from Sequoia Capital in 2023, is reportedly facing challenges in deploying its $9 billion capital pool, leading to frustration among limited partners who continue paying management fees on uninvested capital. While the firm has increased its stakes in existing Chinese portfolio companies like ByteDance and Xiaohongshu, and invested in Chinese robotics and AI startups, it's now actively expanding into Europe and North Asia, including plans for a Tokyo office. This geographic expansion, marked by the opening of a London office, suggests HongShan is seeking new investment opportunities beyond China's borders, potentially putting it in competition with its former partner Sequoia Capital.   Latest In TechOpenAI is offering its employees the opportunity to sell shares worth $1.5 billion to SoftBank Group in a new tender offer, with employees having until December 24 to participate. The deal aligns with OpenAI's recent $6.6 billion funding round in October that valued the company at $157 billion, where SoftBank invested $500 million. This move comes as SoftBank's CEO Masayoshi Son actively seeks to increase his stake in OpenAI, which has seen remarkable growth with ChatGPT attracting 250 million weekly active users. Amazon is creating an AI model named Olympus for video analysis, which could assist users in searching for specific scenes within large video archives, according to The Information. This new AI tool by Amazon is similar to Anthropic's existing multimodal model that also processes images and videos, a startup to which Amazon has committed $8 billion in total investments. Olympus's potential launch at the AWS re:Invent conference could signify Amazon’s strategic move to lessen its reliance on Anthropic by offering its own AI solution for video content. The US Federal Trade Commission has launched a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, focusing on its cloud computing, software licensing, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence sectors. The investigation has intensified following numerous cybersecurity incidents, and involves a lengthy information request from Microsoft, signed off by FTC Chair Lina Khan, as a key part of her regulatory tenure. Complaints from companies like Salesforce and Zoom highlight how Microsoft's bundling practices, particularly with its Teams software, are viewed as anticompetitive and challenge rival firms' ability to compete.   Other News North Korean hackers have been exposed for impersonating remote IT workers, VCs, and recruiters to infiltrate global companies, as revealed at Cyberwarcon. Microsoft researchers found these operatives have penetrated hundreds of organizations using AI-generated identities and U.S.-based facilitators. The hackers have stolen billions in cryptocurrency and sensitive data to fund North Korea's nuclear program, with groups like \"Ruby Sleet\" and \"Sapphire Sleet\" leading these operations. Australia has enacted a novel law restricting social media access for individuals under 16, making it one of the strictest such laws globally. The legislation, driven by concerns for children's mental health, will become effective by the end of next year, blocking platforms like X, Instagram, and TikTok for kids 16 and below. The law faced bipartisan support, but critics worry it might isolate young people, potentially harming vulnerable groups by cutting off digital support networks.   In-Depth InsightsCutting Through the Noise: GenAI Highlights Key developments in Generative AI, with insights into the industry's most impactful innovations.Q3 2024 Enterprise Fintech Report Covers enterprise adoption of fintech solutions and the impact on traditional financial services.2025 Private Markets Predictions Report Explore emerging trends and predictions shaping the startup and VC landscape, compiled by Affinity.You're Not the Same Fund Manager You Used to Be Hunter Walk delves into how evolving market dynamics challenge fund managers to rethink strategies and adapt.  How Can I Help You?Build Your Pitch Deck: We write, design and model your pitch deck into a storyteller book within 4-5 days.Get Your MVP In 15 Days: Have an Idea?

Existing methods reduce costs but often compromise scalability, accuracy, or real-time performance.SolutionStar Attention, introduced by NVIDIA, uses a two-phase block-sparse attention mechanism. In phase one, it applies blockwise-local attention across distributed hosts. In phase two, query and response tokens use sequence-global attention to access cached tokens. This design reduces communication overhead and fits into existing global attention architectures.ResultsStar Attention reduces memory usage and inference time by up to 11x. It maintains 95–100% accuracy across tasks, improving performance for long-sequence models in real-world applications.Agent FrameworkDynaSaur: Large Language Agents Beyond Predefined Actions⇧ 908 LikesProblemExisting LLM agent systems use a fixed set of actions, which limits their ability to plan and requires a lot of human work to list all possible actions in complex environments.SolutionDynaSaur introduces a framework that allows LLM agents to dynamically create and execute actions using a general-purpose programming language. This method enables agents to generate programs at each step and accumulate actions over time for future use.ResultsThe framework provides greater flexibility, outperforming traditional methods, and allows agents to recover when predefined actions fail or do not exist.

It also highlights the current limitations in the field and presents a comprehensive methodology for training high-performance video generation models, covering key aspects such as data, model architecture, training pipeline, and evaluation.ResultsAllegro outperforms existing open-source models and most commercial models, ranking just behind top models like Hailuo and Kling, based on a user study.PYTHON TIPHow to Track Progress in Parallel ProcessingWhen running parallel tasks, tracking progress efficiently can help manage workflows and debug issues in large-scale ML or data processing pipelines.Instead of Usingfrom multiprocessing import Poolwith Pool() as pool:    results = pool.map(worker, tasks)Usefrom multiprocessing import Pool, Managerdef worker(task):    return task ** 2def listener(queue, total_tasks):    completed = 0    for _ in iter(queue.get, None): # Wait for task completion signals        completed += 1        print(f\"Progress: {completed / total_tasks * 100:.2f}%\")if __name__ == \"__main__\":    tasks = list(range(1, 101))  # Example task list    with Manager() as manager:        queue = manager.Queue()        with Pool() as pool:            # Start the progress listener in a separate process            pool.apply_async(listener, (queue, len(tasks)))                        # Define worker wrapper to send task completion signals            def wrapped_worker(task):                result = worker(task)                queue.put(1)  # Signal completion                return result                        # Process tasks and wait for completion            results = pool.map_async(wrapped_worker, tasks)            results.wait()            queue.put(None)  # Signal the listener to stopThe code efficiently tracks and displays real-time progress of parallel tasks using 'multiprocessing.Queue' and a listener function. Each completed task sends a signal to update progress, ensuring accurate reporting during concurrent execution.BenefitsEnables progress tracking.Simplifies monitoring for long-running jobs.Enhances pipeline transparency in multi-process ML workflows.How was today’s email?Awesome    Decent     Not GreatAt Alpha Signal, our mission is to build a sharp, engaged community focused on AI, machine learning, and cutting-edge language models, helping over 200,000 developers stay informed and ahead.

Start building with AI Studio  Venture Capital UpdatesHongShan, the Chinese investment firm that separated from Sequoia Capital in 2023, is reportedly facing challenges in deploying its $9 billion capital pool, leading to frustration among limited partners who continue paying management fees on uninvested capital. While the firm has increased its stakes in existing Chinese portfolio companies like ByteDance and Xiaohongshu, and invested in Chinese robotics and AI startups, it's now actively expanding into Europe and North Asia, including plans for a Tokyo office. This geographic expansion, marked by the opening of a London office, suggests HongShan is seeking new investment opportunities beyond China's borders, potentially putting it in competition with its former partner Sequoia Capital.   Latest In TechPerplexity AI's CEO Aravind Srinivas has announced plans to develop a sub-$50 voice-based AI device after his social media post hit 5,000 likes. While this move follows a trend of AI startups venturing into hardware, with companies like Midjourney and OpenAI exploring similar initiatives, the track record for such ventures has been challenging, as evidenced by Rabbit's R1 facing distribution issues and Humane's Ai Pin struggling with poor reviews and recalls. Despite these industry setbacks, Perplexity appears poised to move forward with its hardware ambitions, backed by substantial funding and reportedly close to raising an additional $500 million. Alibaba's Qwen team has released QwQ-32B-Preview, a new \"reasoning\" AI model with 32.5 billion parameters that outperforms OpenAI's o1 models on certain benchmarks like AIME and MATH tests. While the model excels at solving logic puzzles and math questions through self-fact-checking capabilities, it has limitations including unexpected language switching and struggles with common sense reasoning. Released under an Apache 2.0 license for commercial use, the model notably reflects Chinese political perspectives on sensitive topics, and its emergence comes amid increased industry focus on reasoning models and test-time compute as traditional scaling approaches show diminishing returns. Artists who were beta testers have leaked OpenAI's Sora video model, protesting against unpaid labor and \"art washing\" claims by the company. The artists accuse OpenAI of exploiting their feedback for free without fair compensation, while the company emphasizes that participation in Sora's research preview is voluntary. OpenAI has not confirmed the leak's authenticity but continues to stress its commitment to balancing creativity with safety, aiming to release Sora once safety concerns are addressed.   Other News OpenAI has filed a trademark application for \"OpenAI o1\" with the USPTO, following an earlier foreign trademark application in Jamaica made months before the model's announcement. While OpenAI has previously secured around 30 trademark registrations for products like ChatGPT, Sora, and DALL-E, it notably failed to trademark \"GPT\" due to its generic nature, and is currently engaged in a legal battle with Guy Ravine over the use of \"Open AI,\" though a federal circuit court recently ruled in OpenAI's favor through a preliminary injunction. Elon Musk's AI company xAI is reportedly developing a standalone consumer app similar to ChatGPT to provide access to its Grok chatbot, with the launch expected after closing a $5 billion funding round that could value the company at $50 billion, notably offering 25% of shares to Twitter acquisition backers like Fidelity, Larry Ellison, and Jack Dorsey as compensation for their loyalty.   In-Depth InsightsFoundational equity: Co founders, first hires and fundraising 50 slides of startup data covering everything from co-founder equity through seed round fundraising.Time to Value in the AI Age Akash Bajwa explores how the speed of delivering measurable value is reshaping AI-driven businesses.The Future of LLMs Sarah Tavel explores the evolving use cases and challenges for large language models in diverse industries.The Power of Product Metrics Dive into actionable frameworks for defining and measuring product success metrics in the SaaS world.  How Can I Help You?Build Your Pitch Deck: We write, design and model your pitch deck into a storyteller book within 4-5 days.Get Your MVP In 15 Days: Have an Idea?

Join 29,990 thought leaders from VCs like a16z, Accel, Index, Sequoia, and more to understand how startup investing becomes more data-driven, why it matters, and what it means for you.Upgrade to paidBrought to you by Hubspot for Startups - Unique Fundraising InsightsHubSpot for Startups asked 500 founders and investors across Europe and the US to share their real-world experiences with fundraising. Here's what they told us:What are the tech stacks used to manage investor relations?What growth tactics are truly making a difference?How is AI disrupting the investment scene?What are investors really looking for these days?How long does it take to raise a Seed, Series A, and beyond?We’ve broken down the data into easy-to-understand charts, plus insights from growth-focused founders who are actively scaling.Download free report“You Can’t Teach an Old Dog New Tricks”The biggest barrier to new tech & tool adoption isn’t budget constraints or lack of technical infrastructure - it’s culture. I’ve seen this firsthand in corporate environments, academia, and venture capital: the more senior the individual, the more ingrained their workflows and thought patterns, and the harder it is for them to adapt.Naturally, all eyes are on the fresh, unbiased, and tech-savvy juniors to explore new tools, test and evaluate them, bring them up for budget decisions and eventually explain to and teach the seniors how to use them. Point in case: Who introduced Calendly, SuperHuman, Zapier, and your new CRM system in your organization? ChatGPT? Notion? Slack? The new data source? The list goes on but the answer remains the same: the more junior team members.But what happens when cutting-edge technologies like GenAI demand rapid adoption and integration across the board? Is it sufficient to rely on the juniors to drive this massive change process?Asking myself this question a lot, and working hard to change workflows across our organization for years, I recently came across a fascinating paper “Don’t Expect Juniors to Teach Senior Professionals to Use Generative AI” by leading researchers from MIT, Harvard, Wharton, and Warwich that explores this adoption gap through a fascinating study of junior consultants at Boston Consulting Group. It turns out that while younger professionals might seem like natural ambassadors for new technologies, they often fall short when it comes to helping their senior counterparts integrate modern tools and technologies effectively. The unique findings of this paper are so incredibly valuable that I decided to dedicate this episode to a deep dive and complement it with my own learnings on how to drive tech adoption in a venture capital firm. Learnings are universally applicable and can help you solve tech & tool adoption across any organization.Join 29,990+ thought leaders from VCs like a16z, Accel, Index, Sequoia, and more.Upgrade to paidJunior Professionals: Closer to the Tools, But Not the SolutionTraditionally, junior employees have played a key role in bringing new technologies into organizations. Their proximity to hands-on work and willingness to experiment often positions them as early adopters. But when it comes to emerging technologies like GenAI, juniors may not be the best guides for senior colleagues. The study, which involved interviews with 78 junior consultants who participated in a GenAI experiment, identifies several critical barriers:Surface-Level Familiarity with Technology:Despite their enthusiasm, juniors often lack the technical depth to understand GenAI’s capabilities and limitations. In the study, many junior consultants proposed overly simplistic solutions to complex challenges, reflecting a shallow understanding of the technology.Focus on Human Behavior Over System Design:Instead of advocating for systemic changes, juniors tend to focus on modifying human routines—such as improving prompt-writing skills—without addressing broader design or operational shifts that could maximize the value of GenAI.Project-Level Thinking:Juniors’ recommendations often target individual projects rather than considering the ecosystem-level changes needed for effective GenAI adoption. This narrow focus limits the scalability of their insights.These shortcomings highlight a paradox: while juniors might be expected to lead the charge in GenAI and modern tool adoption, their lack of experience and technical expertise often prevents them from being effective educators or change agents.The Real Barrier: Risk Perception, Not StatusThe traditional narrative around senior resistance to new technologies often focuses on rigid habits but also status dynamics: senior professionals fear losing face or exposing gaps in their expertise. However, this study challenges that assumption. Instead, it finds that seniors’ hesitance is primarily driven by their perception of risks that GenAI poses to key organizational outcomes. These risks include:Accuracy Risks: Concerns about GenAI’s tendency to “hallucinate” or produce incorrect outputs. For senior leaders, errors in data-driven decisions can have catastrophic consequences.Explainability Risks: Unlike previous technologies, GenAI operates as a black box, making it difficult to explain or justify its outputs to stakeholders.Contextual Relevance Risks: There’s a fear that GenAI might overlook critical situational factors, leading to irrelevant or inappropriate recommendations.Engagement Risks: Over-reliance on GenAI could foster complacency, where users accept AI outputs uncritically, potentially undermining accountability and decision-making rigor.Seniors are not rejecting GenAI out of stubbornness or ignorance—they are cautious because the stakes are high, and the technology’s risks are poorly understood or mitigated. This seems also true for modern tools more broadly: “We’ve always done it like that” and there’s a risk that changing established tools and technologies, the outcome might be negatively effected.The Role of Organizational LeadershipFor organizations, the path to GenAI and modern tool adoption requires strategic intervention at multiple levels. Relying solely on juniors to drive adoption is insufficient, but so is expecting seniors to overcome their concerns independently. Instead, leaders must take proactive steps to bridge the gap:Invest in Comprehensive Training:Both juniors and seniors need structured opportunities to build their technical understanding of GenAI. Training programs should go beyond basic use cases to address underlying risks, system limitations, and mitigation strategies.Encourage Cross-Level Collaboration:Instead of positioning juniors as sole educators, create opportunities for juniors and seniors to collaborate in learning environments. This can reduce the risk of status-driven resistance while allowing juniors to contribute their fresh perspectives.Rethink System Design:GenAI adoption shouldn’t rely on individuals adapting their workflows. Instead, organizations should prioritize system-level changes—such as integrating GenAI into existing processes, improving user interfaces, and aligning AI capabilities with business objectives.Adopt an Ecosystem Perspective:Effective GenAI deployment requires thinking beyond individual projects. Leaders must consider how the technology fits within broader organizational and industry ecosystems, addressing challenges like data quality, regulatory compliance, and cross-departmental integration.Implications for OrganizationsThis study’s findings have profound implications for any organization grappling with GenAI and modern tool adoption:Junior Professionals Are Not Enough: While juniors may excel at experimenting with new tools, their lack of depth and focus on narrow solutions limits their ability to drive meaningful change. Organizations must complement junior enthusiasm with senior leadership and strategic oversight.Risk Management Is Key: To address seniors’ concerns, organizations must prioritize transparency, explainability, and accountability in their GenAI deployments. This includes designing systems that proactively mitigate risks and align with organizational values.Cultural Change Takes Time: The cultural shift required for GenAI adoption won’t happen overnight. Leaders must invest in ongoing education, communication, and collaboration to build trust and confidence across all levels of the organization.Share this article with others who might benefit.ShareConclusionSummarizing the paper and reflecting on my own experience, I couldn’t agree more with their takeaways. Tech and tool adoption of course requires budgets, technical infrastructure, the right talent, and more. But eventually, it all comes down to the right change management and culture.It’s not sufficient to hire “the data guy (or girl)” or rely on the juniors to explore and establish new tool and tech stacks in your firm. It equally requires the domain expertise, buy-in and budgets, and willingness to change of the senior leaders too.Organizations that succeed will be those that address these cultural dynamics head-on, fostering an environment where juniors and seniors alike can engage with modern solutions confidently and collaboratively.The future of knowledge work will be shaped by those who embrace change—not just in tools, but in mindsets.

            "Buenas Pablo&Team,Tal y como he comentado con Pablo por Linkedin, os comento un poco sobre mi:Llevo dos años ahora en Athos Capital haciendo VC, pero mi día a día ha evolucionado a algo bastante diferente del VC típico. Me dedico a analizar sobre todo oportunidades de hard tech (developer tools, data infra, cyber...) y todo aquello que tenga un componente de AI relevante y que se algo más que humo.El resto del tiempo, me dedico a construir nuestra plataforma interna - automatizando todo lo que puedo con Python, LLMs y conectando APIs y external data para agilizar cómo analizamos startups y generamos investment memos. En estos momentos, y junto a algunos blogs técnicos que voy escribiendo (https://www.athos-cap.com/views/), es lo que más me motiva del trabajo y donde intento invertir la mayor parte de mi tiempo.Vengo de un background técnico (Matemáticas, y algunos proyectos de research), y aunque no soy un ingeniero full-stack, me defiendo bastante bien con Python y todo lo que sea entender o implementar research papers.Últimamente me he metido bastante a fondo con el tema Transformers y he hecho una pequeña collab con el equipo de Manifest.ai.He reimplementado en Pytorch y propuesto una mejora a su arquitectura de Symmetric Power Transformers (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QDICw9PkjXuGX9GPPNGg_lcBTb0QCd0O?usp=sharing).Estoy buscando unirme a una startup que tenga un componente técnico fuerte.Me hablaran de vosotros, y me ha llamado mucho la atención lo que estáis construyendo en Happyrobot.He visto que tenéis varias posiciones abiertas, y creo que podría encajar en la posición de Solutions Engineer, además de poder colaborar en todo lo que sea ML Research.Si os parece bien, me encantaría poder tener una llamada con vosotros para conocernos y contaros un poco más.Os adjunto también mi CV más formal.Un saludo!Marc.\n",

            "I am happy to introduce you to StepAlong, a Barcelona based company that is opening for a 1mE seed round. The founding team is made of three founders who were part of the founding team at ReviewPro, a notable success/exit in the SaaS for customer service space.\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "StepAlong is an AI First Product Instruction Platform to create, distribute and manage effective product instructions that improve the customer experience for consumer goods companies selling physical products. In other terms they replace with AI generated solutions the very outdated and cumbersome PDFs currently used for instructions. The objective is to reduce production costs, improve customer satisfaction and increase online sales, therefore directly impacting companies profit.\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "They have reached PMF with first customers onboarded and an interesting pipeline. They operate as a SaaS B2B model, with a delivery-based pricing model typical of AI fist solutions.\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "After being funded mostly by the founders and a few F&Fs, including myself, they are now seeking seed funding to accelerate bringing the product to market with a proper sales machine.\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "I am copying Tim Towle, their CEO, in case you want to explore further the opportunity.\r\n",

Fugatto offers unmatched flexibility in the audio domain, enabling users to create unique sounds and finely-tuned audio experiences, incorporating diverse styles, emotions, and accents. Developed by a global team, the model boasts multi-accent and multilingual capabilities, and uses 2.5 billion parameters trained on advanced Nvidia systems, redefining audio generation technology.   Other News The Figure 02 robot, developed by Figure AI and tested at a BMW plant, achieved a remarkable 400% increase in operational speed and a sevenfold enhancement in success rate.
